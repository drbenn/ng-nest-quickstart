Amazon SES Setup

1. Verify Your Email Address or Domain:

    - In the SES Management Console, go to the "Verified identities" section and add the email address you want to send emails from. Verify it by clicking the link sent to that email.
    - (Optional) If you want to send emails from multiple addresses in the same domain, verify the domain instead of individual emails.

2. Request Production Access (optional for testing):
    - SES starts in the sandbox environment, where you can send emails only to verified email addresses. To send emails to unverified addresses, submit a request to move your account to production.
